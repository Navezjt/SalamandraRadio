# Features
* Player with support for major audio files (wav, mp3, wma, ogg and flac)
* Multiple track selection modes, like random, shuffle or manual for playback control.
* Special tracks, like time announcements and random audio files from a folder.
* A versatile events scheduler, for audio files or starting/stopping playback, at an scheduled day and time or periodically, like days of weeks or hours.
* A simplified player to pre-listen audio files in another sound output.
* Auto-generated log files to register any player activity or errors.

# Getting Started
You can download the <a href="https://github.com/ocarolino/SalamandraRadio/releases/latest/download/Salamandra.rar">latest release</a>, unzip and open Salamandra.exe. There's no need for installation or extra configurations. We have these tutorials at the moment:

- <a href="https://github.com/ocarolino/SalamandraRadio/blob/main/Docs/How%20to%20Install.pt-br.md">How to install/update Salamandra</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/ocarolino/SalamandraRadio/blob/main/Docs/Getting%20Started.md">Getting started</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/ocarolino/SalamandraRadio/blob/main/Docs/How%20to%20create%20CurrentSong.md">How to create a CurrentSong file</a>

In our tutorials you can see an overview of Salamandra functionalities. But even for settings not explained yet, Salamandra is designed to be intuitive, with all relevant functions written in a clear manner. You can also put the cursor on top of any option and read an explanation of what it does.

# Contributions
First of all, thanks for thinking in contributing to this project! Salamandra is an freeware software, but not open source - this does not mean that contributions are not welcome! 

You can always contribute with testing, documentation, translations, reporting bugs or sharing ideas for new functionalities.

Right now, what we really need is testing. All functionalities are stable in our testing enviroments, but bugs and unexpected behaviors can happen in differents setups, even more in these initial releases.

# Donations

Salamandra is a completely free software, you don't have to pay in any way to use it with all its functions. However, it is a software developed in my free time as a hobby to practice programming.

If you consider it useful for your radio or work in any way and wish to make a monetary contribution, feel free to contribute with a token donation through the links below:
